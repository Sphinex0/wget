Kushner received the Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the  University of Wisconsin in 1958. Since then, in ten books and more than  two hundred papers, he has established a substantial part of modern  stochastic systems theory. These include seminal developments of  stochastic stability for both Markovian and non-Markovian systems,  optimal nonlinear filtering and effective algorithms for approximating  optimal nonlinear filters, stochastic variational methods and the  stochastic maximum principle, numerical methods for jump-diffusion type  control and game problems (the current methods of choice), efficient  numerical methods for Markov chain models, methods for singularly  perturbed stochastic systems, an extensive development of controlled  stochastic networks  such as queueing/communications systems under  conditions of heavy traffic, methods for the analysis and approximation   of  systems driven by wideband noise, large-deviation methods for  control problems with small noise effects,  stochastic distributed and  delay systems, and nearly optimal control and filtering for  non-Markovian systems. <br/><br/> His work on stochastic approximations and recursive algorithms  has set much of the  current framework, and he has contributed heavily  to applications of control methods to communications problems. <br/><br/> He is a past Chairman of the Applied Mathematics Department  and  past Director of the Lefschetz Center for Dynamical Systems,  at  Brown  University, where he is currently a University Professor Emeritus.</p>

<p>It is a great honor to receive this award.  It is a particular honor that it is in memory of Richard Bellman. I  doubt that there are many here who knew Bellman, so I would like to make  some comments concerning his role in the field. <br/><br/> Bellman left RAND after the summer of 1965 for the position  of Professor of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine at the  University of Southern California. This triple title gives you some  inkling of how he was viewed at the time. I spent that summer at RAND.  My office was right next to Bellman's and we had lots of opportunity to  talk. <br/><br/> Bellman was always very supportive of my work. He encouraged  me to write my first book, Stochastic Stability and Control, in 1967  for his Academic Press Series. Although naive by modern standards, the  book seemed to have a significant impact on subsequent development in  that it made many mathematicians realize that there was serious  probability to be done in stochastic control, and established the  foundations of stochastic stability theory. Numerical methods were among  his strong interests. He was well acquainted with my work on numerical  methods for continuous time stochastic systems and encouraged me to  write my first book on the subject, later updated in two books with Paul  Dupuis, and still the methods of choice. Despite his enormous output of  published papers, something like 900, he was a strong believer in books  since they allowed one to develop a subject with considerable freedom. <br/><br/> There are other connections, albeit indirect, between us. He  was a New Yorker, and did his early undergraduate work at CCNY. During  those years and, indeed, until the late 50's, CCNY was one of the most  intellectual institutions of higher learning in the US. During that  time, before the middle class migration out of the city, and the  simultaneous opening of opportunities in the elite institutions for the  "typical New Yorker," CCNY had the choice of the best of New Yorkers  with a serious intellectual bent. Later, he switched to Brooklyn  College, which was much closer to his home. <br/><br/> He intended to be a pure mathematician: His primary interest  was analytic number theory. When did he become interested in  applications? He graduated college at the start of WW2 and the demands  of the war exposed him to a great variety of problems. He taught  electronics in Princeton and then worked at a sonar lab in San Diego  (which kept him out of the Army for a while). He spent the last two  years of the war in the army, but assigned to the Manhattan project at  Los Alamos. He was a social creature and it was easy for him to meet  many of the talented people working on the project. Typically, the  physicists considered a mathematician as simply a human calculator,  ideally constructed to do numerical computations but not much more.  Bellman was asked to numerically solve some PDE's. His mathematical  pride refused. To the great surprise of the physicists, he actually  managed to integrate some of the equations, obtaining closed form  solutions. Holding true to tradition, they checked his solutions, not by  verifying the derivation, but by trying some very special cases. Thus  his reputation there as a very bright young mathematician was  established. This jealously guarded independence and self confidence  (and lack of modesty) continued to serve him well. During these years,  he absorbed a great variety of scientific experiences. So much was being  done due to the needs of the war. <br/><br/> There is one more indirect connection between us. Bellman  was a student of Solomon Lefschetz at Princeton, head of the Math. Dept.  at the time, a very tough minded mathematician and one of the  powerhouses of American mathematics, and impressed with Bellman's  ability. While at Los Alamos in WW2 Bellman worked out various results  on stability of ODE's. Although he initially intended to do a thesis  with someone else on a number theoretic problem, Lefschetz convinced him  that those stability results were the quickest way to a thesis, which  was in fact true. It took only several months and was the basis of his  book on stability of ODE's. I was the director of the Lefschetz Center  for Dynamical Systems at Brown University for many years, with Lefschetz  our patron saint. Some of you might recall the book (not the movie) "A  Beautiful Mind" about John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Game Theory, which  describes Lefschetz's key role in mathematics during Nash's time at  Princeton. <br/><br/> Bellman spent the summer of 1948 at RAND, where an amazing  array of talent was gathered, including David Blackwell, George Dantzig,  Ted Harris, Sam Karlin, Lloyd Shapley, and many others, who provided  the foundations of much of decision and game theory. The original  intention was to do mathematics with some of the RAND talent on problems  of prior interest. But Bellman turned out to be fascinated and  partially seduced by the excitement in OR, and the developing role of  mathematics in the social and biological sciences. His mathematical  abilities were widely recognized. He was a tenured Associate Professor  at Stanford at 28, after being an Associate Professor at Princeton,  where all indications were that he would have had an assured future had  he remained there. He began to have doubts about the payoff for himself  in number theory and returned to the atmosphere at RAND often, where he  eventually settled and became fully involved in multistage decision  processes, having been completely seduced, and much to our great  benefit. <br/><br/> Here is a non mathematical item that should be of interest.  To work at RAND one needed a security clearance, even though much of the  work did not involve "security." Due to an anonymous tip, Bellman lost  his clearance for a while: His brother-in-law, whom Bellman had not seen  since he (his brother-in-law) was about 13, was rumored to be a  communist? This was an example of a serious national problem that was  fed, exploited, and made into a national paranoia by unscrupulous  politicians. <br/><br/> Bellman was a remarkable person, thoroughly a man of his  time and renaissance in his interests, with a fantastic memory. Some  epochs are represented by individuals that are towering because of their  powerful personalities and abilities. People who could not be ignored.  Bellman was one of those. He was one of the driving forces behind the  great intellectual excitement of the times. <br/><br/> The word programming was used by the military to mean  scheduling. Dantzig's linear programming was an abbreviation of  "programming with linear             models." Bellman has described the origin of the name  "dynamic programming" as follows. An Assistant Secretary of the             Air Force, who was believed to be strongly anti-mathematics  was to visit RAND. So Bellman was concerned that his work on             the mathematics of multi-stage decision process would be  unappreciated. But "programming" was still OK, and the Air Force was  concerned with rescheduling continuously due to uncertainties. Thus  "dynamic programming" was chosen a politically wise descriptor. On the  other hand, when I asked him the same question, he replied that he was  trying to upstage Dantzig's linear programming by adding dynamic.  Perhaps both motivations were true. <br/><br/> If one looks closely at scientific discoveries, ancient  seeds often appear. Bellman did not quite invent dynamic programming,  and many others contributed to its early development. It was used  earlier in inventory control. Peter Dorato once showed me a (somwhat  obscure) economics paper from the late thirties where something close to  the principle of optimality was used. The calculus of variations had  related ideas (e.g., the work of Caratheodory, the Hamilton-Jacobi  equation). This led to conflicts with the calculus of variations  community. But no one grasped its essence, isolated its essential  features, and showed and promoted its full potential in control and  operations research as well as in applications to the biological and  social sciences, as did Bellman. <br/><br/> Bellman published many seminal works. It is sometimes  claimed that many of his vast number of papers are repetitive and did  not develop the ideas as far as they could have been. Despite this  criticism, his works were poured over word for word, with every comment  and detail mined for ideas, technique, and openings into new areas. His  work was a mother lode. It was clearly the work of someone with a superb  background in analysis as well as a facile mind and sharp eye for  aplications. There are lots of examples, with broad coverage,  accessible, and usually simple assumptions. His writing is articulate.  It flows very smoothly through the problem formulation and mathematical  analysis, and he is in full command of it. <br/><br/> We still owe a great debt to him.</p>
